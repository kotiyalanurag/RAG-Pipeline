       " Document(page_content='Tax information\\n1 Income tax\\n1.1 The tax treatment of contributions\\nContributions from capital life insurance policies are not tax deductible as special expenses.\\n1.2 The tax treatment of the capital payment\\na)Full difference\\nPayments from a life insurance policy are subject to tax. The difference between the payout \\namount and the total of the premiums paid is taxable.\\nWe have to levy a 25 percent capital gains tax on this difference. We pay this directly to the relevant tax \\noffice in accordance with Section 43 Paragraph 3 Sentence 1 of the Income Tax Act, as well as the \\nassociated solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, church tax (see also c).\\nThis means that the income tax on this income is paid (withholding tax). A more favorable assessment \\n(withholding tax or individual taxation) can be requested by the taxpayer as part of the income tax \\nreturn.\\nb)Half the difference\\nOnly half of the difference is subject to income tax if the payment is made after twelve years from the \\nconclusion of the contract and after the taxpayer has reached the age of 62.\\nIn this case, the insurance company will still pay capital gains tax, solidarity surcharge and, if \\napplicable, church tax on the full difference. These tax amounts are advance payments on personal \\nincome tax. The amount of tax actually payable is then only determined as part of the taxpayer\\'s \\nincome tax assessment using his or her individual tax rate, taking into account the amount paid by the \\ninsurer.\\nc)Automatic church tax deduction procedure for the withholding tax\\nFrom January 1, 2015, church tax on capital gains taxed at a flat rate will be automatically withheld \\nand paid to the religious communities that collect the tax. \"Automatic\" means that as a member of \\nyour religious community, you will no longer have to do anything else to meet your church tax \\nobligations in connection with the flat rate tax.\\nIf you do not want us to collect the church tax on capital gains subject to final taxation, but rather the \\ntax office responsible for you, you must object to the transmission of your religious affiliation to us. \\nAn officially prescribed form for this blocking notice declaration is available at www.formulare-\\nbfinv.de under the keyword \"church tax\", which you must submit to the Federal Central Tax Office \\n(BZSt).\\nIf a blocking notice has been issued or there is no obligation to pay church tax, we will receive a neutral \\nzero value in response to our request. This value has no content and cannot be interpreted. It is \\ntherefore not possible to draw any conclusions about religious affiliation or non- religious affiliation, nor \\ncan it be used to determine whether a blocking notice exists or not.\\nd)Miscellaneous\\nUpon your request, we will issue a corresponding tax certificate.\\nBy submitting an exemption order or a non- assessment certificate, you can prevent the withholding \\nof capital gains tax, solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, church tax in whole or in part.\\nCapital payments in the event of death are fully exempt from income tax.\\nPage 1 of 3\\nBASIC_PACK_WBWB/ D/1006/ XIII/ 03/22', metadata={'source': '/Users/anuragkotiyal/Desktop/engaige/docs_en/Basispaket+WeitBlick_en.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

At the taxpayer's request, we will issue a certificate stating the amount of premiums paid at the time \\nof the sale.\\n1.5 Taxpayer\\nIn principle, the taxpayer within the meaning of Section 20 Paragraph 1 No. 6 of the Income Tax Act is the person who has \\ntransferred the capital in the form of savings shares to the insurance company for use in his own name and for his own account.\\nAs a rule, policyholders are liable to pay tax – in the case of two policyholders, in proportion to their \\nshares in the contract – since they have provided the savings shares for use and also hold the right to \\nclaim the insurance benefit.\\nBy granting an irrevocable right to subscribe to the taxable insurance benefit, the beneficiary is generally \\nconsidered to be liable to pay tax on the income generated.\\n1.6 Inheritance tax and gift tax\\nInsurance benefits paid to the policyholder themselves are exempt from inheritance tax. Benefits paid to \\nsurvivors are subject to inheritance tax. Whether inheritance tax has to be paid depends on the amount of \\nthe total inheritance taxable acquisition and the personal allowance of the acquirer.\\nIf the policyholder and the recipient of the insurance benefit are not the same, we must submit a report \\nto the tax office before paying out the benefits. Due to the regulations in Section 20 Paragraph 6 of the \\nInheritance Tax Act (ErbStG), we require a\\nCertificate of clearance from the tax office if the payment is to be made abroad.\\nIf an insurance policy is transferred free of charge during the lifetime of the policyholder or if the shares \\nin the contract are changed for two policyholders, the resulting transfers are subject to gift tax. Whether \\ngift tax has to be paid depends on the amount of the total gift tax acquisition and the personal allowance \\nof the purchaser.\\nWe must report any change of policyholder or, in the case of two policyholders, any change in the shares \\nin the contract to the tax office responsible for the new policyholder.\\n2 Insurance tax\\nAccording to Section 4 of the Insurance Tax Act (VersStG), contributions to capital life insurance policies are \\nexempt from insurance tax if you, as the policyholder, have your place of residence or habitual abode in the \\nFederal Republic of Germany.\\nIf you move your place of residence to another country, your insurance contract may be subject to insurance \\ntax in accordance with the tax legislation there. We may then be obliged to charge you this insurance tax \\nand pay it to the relevant authorities.\\npage 2 of 3\\nBASIC_PACK_WBWB/ D/1006/ XIII/ 03/22\", metadata={'source': '/Users/anuragkotiyal/Desktop/engaige/docs_en/Basispaket+WeitBlick_en.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Tax information\\n3 VAT\\nIn the case of capital life insurance, premiums and benefits are exempt from sales tax.\\n4 Data exchange between Germany and the partner states\\nLike several other countries, Germany has committed itself to exchanging tax data in international matters \\nin order to promote tax honesty. The respective countries commit themselves to the automatic mutual \\nexchange of information among themselves (participating countries).\\nTo this end, insurance companies, among others, must collect data and transmit it to the Federal Central \\nTax Office, which forwards the data to the relevant foreign tax authorities in the participating countries.\\nPolicyholders are generally obliged to provide their insurance company with information about their tax \\nresidence outside of Germany. However, insurance companies are only required to report contracts for \\nwhich there is a tax residence in one or more participating countries.\\nIn the event of the death of the policyholder, the beneficiaries entitled to benefits take \\nhis place, even if they are resident for tax purposes in a third country.\\nIf we are required by law to collect and report information and data relating to your contract, you must \\nprovide us with the information, data and documents required for this purpose immediately - i.e. without \\nundue delay - when the contract is concluded, when changes are made after the contract is concluded or \\nupon request. You are also obliged to cooperate if the status of third parties who have rights to your \\ncontract is relevant for data collection and reporting.\\nThe information to be obtained and exchanged includes, among other things, personal details, address, \\ntax identification number of the policyholder or the surviving beneficiaries, contract number and the value \\nof the contract at the end of the calendar year or at the time of the benefit payment.\\nIf you move your place of residence to another country, this may result in a change in the tax treatment \\nof your insurance contract.\\n5. Note for accounting companies\\nThe above tax information does not generally apply to policyholders in the legal form of a company that \\nprepares financial statements. Companies that prepare financial statements can usually claim the \\ncontributions as business expenses for tax purposes. In return, the insurance benefit from the \\nreinsurance represents business income for the employer. The value of the insurance is part of the \\ncompany's assets and must be capitalized.\\nIf the insurance benefit consists of a capital payment, the insurance company must withhold 25 percent \\ncapital gains tax plus the solidarity surcharge on the full difference and pay it to the tax office. Companies \\nsubject to corporation tax are not subject to the flat-rate tax that has been in force since 2009.\\nSince the reinsurance is always taxed when activated, the company as policyholder can offset the capital \\ngains tax against the next tax prepayment.
